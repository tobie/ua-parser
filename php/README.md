# ua-parser PHP Library #

This is the PHP library for the [ua-parser](https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser) project.

## v2.0 Changes ##

v2.0 of the PHP library, released in December 2012, marked a huge transition from the previous pseudo-port of `ua-parser` to a true port that matches up well with the other libraries in the `ua-parser` repo. The primary changes:

* the `UAParser` class is now dynamic
* properties are nested _(e.g. $result->family is now $result->ua->family)_
* a user agent string is now required when using `parse()`. the auto-magical "use the server provided UA" is no longer supported.
* `uaParser()`, `osParser()`, and `deviceParser()` are public and can be used to just return those select bits for a given user agent string.
* the `is*` boolean properties _(e.g. isMobile)_ have been dropped. they now exist as part of the `ua-classifier` project.

Please refer to the `CHANGELOG` for the full list of changes.

## Demo ##

You can [test the PHP library](http://uaparser.dmolsen.com/) with your browser.

## Usage ##

Straightforward:

```php
require("uaparser.php");

$ua = "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Ma...";

$parser = new UAParser;
$result = $parser->parse($ua);

print $result->ua->family;                // Safari
print $result->ua->major;                 // 6
print $result->ua->minor;                 // 0
print $result->ua->patch;                 // 2
print $result->ua->toString;              // Safari 6.0.2
print $result->ua->toVersionString;       // 6.0.2

print $result->os->family;                // Mac OS X
print $result->os->major;                 // 10
print $result->os->minor;                 // 7
print $result->os->patch;                 // 5
print $result->os->patch_minor;           // [null]
print $result->os->toString;              // Mac OS X 10.7.5
print $result->os->toVersionString;       // 10.7.5

print $result->device->family;            // Other

print $result->toFullString;              // Safari 6.0.2/Mac OS X 10.7.5
print $result->uaOriginal;                // Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Ma...
```

## Using ua-parser PHP Library from the Command Line ##

A command line utility is now included with the PHP library. The following commands are supported:

### Get Usage Info

Provides simple usage information:

    php uaparser-cli.php

### Update the regexes.json File

Fetches an updated YAML file for `ua-parser` and overwrites the current JSON file. You can use the following as part of a cron job that runs nightly. 

    php uaparser-cli.php -g [-s] [-n]
        
By default is verbose. Use `-s` to turn that feature off. By default creates a back-up. Use `-n` to turn that feature off.

### Convert an Existing regexes.yaml File to regexes.json

With the change to v2.0 you may have an existing and customized YAML file for `ua-parser`. Use the following to convert it to JSON.

    php uaparser-cli.php -c [-s] [-n]

By default is verbose. Use `-s` to turn that feature off. By default creates a back-up. Use `-n` to turn that feature off.

### Grab Just the Latest regexes.yaml File From the Repository

If you need to add a new UA it's easier to edit the original YAML and then convert it to JSON.

    php uaparser-cli.php -y

Fetches an updated YAML file. *Warning:* This method overwrites any existing `regexes.yaml` file.

### Parse an Apache Log File

Parses the supplied Apache log file to test UAParser.php. Saves the UA to a file when the UA or OS family aren't recognized or when the UA is listed as a generic smartphone or as a generic feature phone.

    php uaparser-cli.php -l "/path/to/apache/logfile"
        

### Parse a Single User Agent String

Parses a user agent string and dumps the results as a list.

    php uaparser-cli.php [-j] "your user agent string"
           
Use the `-j` flag to print the result as JSON.
