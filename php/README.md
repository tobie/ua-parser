# ua-parser PHP Library #

This is the PHP library for the [ua-parser](https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser) project. This library
utilizes the user agents regex YAML file from ua-parser but otherwise creates its own set of attributes to describe a browser, OS, and device.

## Demo ##

You can [test the PHP library](http://uaparser.dmolsen.com/) with your browser.

## Usage ##

Straightforward:

    <?php

       require("UAParser.php");
       $result = UA::parse();

       print $result->full;
       // -> Chrome 16.0.912/Mac OS X 10.6.8

       print $result->browserFull;
       // -> "Chrome 16.0.912"
		
       print $result->browser;
       // -> "Chrome"
		
       print $result->version;
       // -> "16.0.912"
		
       print $result->major;
       // -> 16 (minor, build, & revision also available)
		
       print $result->osFull;
       // -> "Mac OS X 10.6.8"
		
       print $result->os;
       // -> "Mac OS X"
		
       print $result->osVersion;
       // -> "10.6.8"
		
       print $result->osMajor;
       // -> 10 (osMinor, osBuild, & osRevision also available)

       /* 
        * in select cases the device information will also be captured
        */

       print $result->deviceFull;
       // -> "Palm Pixi 1.0"
       
       print $result->device;
       // -> "Palm Pixi"

       print $result->deviceVersion;
       // -> "1.0"

       print $result->deviceMajor;
       // -> 1 (deviceMinor also available)

       /*
        * Some other generic boolean options
        */

       print $result->isMobile;
       // -> (would return true if the browser met the criteria of a mobile browser based on the user agent information)

       print $result->isMobileDevice;
       // -> (would return true if the device met the criteria of a mobile device based on the user agent information)

       print $result->isTablet;
       // -> (would return true if the device was a tablet according to the user agent information)

       print $result->isSpider;
       // -> (would return true if the device was a spider according to the user agent information)

       print $result->isComputer;
       // -> (would return true if the device was a computer according to the user agent information)

       print $result->isUIWebview;
       // -> (would return true if the user agent was from a uiwebview in ios)

    ?>

## Getting the User-Agent Data ##

To get the user-agent data for either the initial load of the project or each night as a cron job you can use the following on the command line:

    %: cd /path/to/project/
    %: php UAParser.php -get

If you use the cron job method it's highly encouraged that you run `UAParser.php -get` in silent mode. To do so do the following:

    %: php UAParser.php -get -silent

You can also turn off back-ups by doing the following:

    %: php UAParser.php -get -nobackup

And you can run in silent mode and turn off back-ups by doing the following:

    %: php UAParser.php -get -silent -nobackup

Alternatively, you can create a PHP script that includes the following:

    <?php

			require("/path/to/UAParser.php");
			UA::get();
			
    ?>

The `silent` and `nobackup` variables can also be modified directly in the `UAParser.php` script on lines #36 and #37 respectively.

## Using ua-parser For a Redirect Script ##

It's very simple to use ua-parser as a redirect script. To do so do the following:

    <?php

    	// require the ua-parser-php library
    	require_once("/path/to/UAParser.php");

    	// parse the requesting user agent
    	$result = UA::parse();

    	// redirect phones, to redirect tablets use isMobileDevice
    	if ($result->isMobile) {
    		header("location:http://dmolsen.com");
    	}
	
	    // run through the rest of your code for the page for desktop devices & spiders
	
    ?>

You can use any of the properties above to perform the redirect but the boolean options are probably easiest.
